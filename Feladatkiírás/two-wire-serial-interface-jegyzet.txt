INTRODUCTION
******************************************
* two bi-directional bus lines: serial clock (SCL) and serial data (SDA)
* both lines are connected to VCC through pullup resistors

TERMINOLOGY
* master: initiates and terminates transmissions; generates SCL clock
* slave: device addressed by the master
* transmitter: device placing data on the bus
* receiver: device reading data on the bus

ELECTRICAL INTERCONNECTION
* all devices on the bus are open-drain -> wired AND function
* LOW on line -> one or more devices on LOW
* HIGH on line -> all are on HIGH
* bus capacitance limit: 400pF
* two specifications: 100kHz OR 400kHz speed

******************************************
DATA TRANSFER AND FRAME FORMAT
******************************************
TRANSFERRING BITS
* each data bit is accompanied by a pulse on the clock line
* the level of data must be stable when SCL is HIGH
* exepction: START/STOP conditions

START AND STOP CONDITIONS
* any transmission is initiated with a START condition from the master and is terminated when the master issues a STOP condition
* between STOP and START the bus is busy
* only a REPEATED START condition can occur between START and STOP, and it starts a new transmission
* (REPEATED) START: SCL: HIGH; SDA: HIGH->LOW
* STOP: SCL: HIGH; SDA: LOW->HIGH

ADDRESS PACKET FORMAT
* address packet (9-bits): 7-bit address + 1-bit direction + 1-bit acknowledge
* if a slave is being addressed it should acknowledge by pulling SDA to LOW in the ninth SCL cycle
* if it's busy, than the SDA shall left high in the ninth SCL cycle
* then the master do a REPEATED START condition

* the MSB of the address byte is transmitted first
* adress 0000000 is general call

* at a general call, all slaves should respond by pulling the SDA line low in the ACK cycle
* it is used when the master wants to transmit the same message to several slaves
* general call followed by a READ bit is meaningless
* all addresses of the format 1111xxx should be reserved for future purposes

DATA PACKET FORMAT
* all data are 9 bits long: data byte and acknowledge bit
* ACK is signalled by pulling the SDA LOW by the receiver during the ninth SCL cycle
* if SDA is HIGH in the ninth cycle it means NACK
* when the receiver gets the last byte it shall inform the transmitter by sending a NACK
* the MSB data byte is transmitted first

COMBINING ADDRESS AND DATA PACKETS INTO A TRANSMISSION
* transmission: START + SLA+R/W + DATA+ACK + ... + STOP
* empty message (START+STOP) is illegal
* the wired-AND of the SCL line can be used: the slave can extend the SCL LOW period by pulling the SCL line low (useful when the clock speed is too fast); this doesnt affect the clock time of the HIGH period (as it is determined by the master)

MULTI-MASTER BUS SYSTEMS
******************************************
* not important for us since the DS1307 is a slave in our system

******************************************
OVERVIEW OF THE TWI MODULE
******************************************
SCL AND SDA PINS
* output drivers have slew-rate limiter
* input drivers have spike filters
* the internal pullup resistors can be enabled by setting the PORT bits corresponding to the SCL and SDA pins
* the internal pullups can eliminate the need of external pullup resistors
* SCL -> PD0; SDA -> PD1 pins
* to set up the pullup resistors:
  > DDRD = (0<<PD0) | (0<<PD1);
  > PORTD = (1<<PD0) | (1<<PD0);

BIT RATE GENERATOR UNIT
* this unit controls the period of SCL when operating in a Master mode
* this period is controlled by the settings in the TWI Bit Rate Register (TWBR) and the Prescaler bits in the TWI Status Register (TWSR)
* (in slave operation the CPU clock frequency must be 16x higher than the SCL frequency)
* the SCL frequency is generated according to the equation:
  - SCL frequency = (CLKio)/(16 + 2*(TWBR)*4^(TWPS))
  - where TWBR: value of the TWBR register [should be 10 or higher]
  - and TWPS: value of the prescaler bits in the TWSR register

BUS INTERFACE UNIT
* this unit contains the Data and Address Shift Register (TWDR), and START/STOP controller
* TWDR (8-bit) contains the address or data bytes to be trasmitted or received
* this unit also contains a register containing the (N)ACK bit to be transmitted or recieved
* the (N)ANCK register is not directly accessible, but when recieving it can be set or cleared by manipulating the TWI Control Register (TWCR)
* when in transmitter mode, the value of the recieved (N)ACK bit can be determined by the value in the TWSR

ADDRESS MATCH UNIT
* the address unit checks if received address bytes match the 7-bit address in the TWI Address Register (TWAR)
* if the TWI General Call Recognition Enable (TWGCE) bit in the TWAR is written to 1, all incoming address bits will also be compared against the General Call address
* if an address matches -> Control Unit is informed to take actions

CONTROL UNIT
* this unit monitors the TWI bus and generates responses corresponding to the settings in the TWCR register
* when an event occurs on the bus, the TWI Interrupt Flag (TWINT) is asserted
* in the next cycle the TWSR register is updated with a status code identifying the event
* as long as the TWINT flag is set, the SCL line is held LOW
* the TWINT flag is set in the following situations:
  - after START/REPEATED START condition
  - after SLA+R/W
  - after address byte
  - after received data byte
  - after STOP condition

TWI REGISTER DESCRIPTION
for more information datasheet pp. 212-215
******************************************
TWI BIT RATE REGISTER (TWBR)
* Bits 7...0
  - selects the division factor for the bit rate generator (in the eqation above)

TWI CONTROL REGISTER (TWCR)
* Bit 7 - TWINT: TWI Interrupt Flag
  - set by hardware
  - while the TWINT flag is set the SCL low period is streched
  - the TWINT must be cleared by writing a 1
  - it is not automatically cleared
  - clearing this flag starts the operation of the TWI, so all accesses to the TWAR, TWSR and TWDR must be complete before clearing this flag
* Bit 6 - TWEA: TWI Enable Acknowledge Bit
  - if TWEA: 1 -> the ACK pulse is generated if the conditions are met:
    + the decice's own slave address has been received
    + general call has been recieved
    + data byte has been received
  - if TWEA: 0 -> the device virtually disconnects from the TWI Serial Bus temporarly
  - address recognition can then be resumed by writing 1 to TWEA
* Bit 5 - TWSTA: TWI START Condition Bit
  - the application writes a 1 to TWSTA when it wants to start the bus
  - TWSTA must be cleared when the START condition has been transmitted
* Bit 4 - TWSTO: TWI STOP Condition Bit
  - TWSTO: 1 -> generates a STOP condition
  - when STOP condition is generated, this is cleared automatically
* Bit 3 - TWWC: TWI Write Collision Flag
  - it is set when attempting to write to the TWDR when TWINT is low
  - cleared by writing the TWDR Register when TWINT is high
* Bit 2 - TWEN: TWI Enable Bit
  - TWEN: 1 -> TWI takes control over the I/O pins connected to the SCL and SDA (PD0 and PD1)
  - TWEN: 0 -> TWI is switched off
* Bit 1 - Reserved Bit
  - must be written to 0
* Bit 0 - TWIE: TWI Interrupt Enable
  - TWIE: 1 -> TWI interrupt request is activated as long as the TWINT flag is HIGH

TWI STATUS REGISTER - TWSR
* Bit 7...3 - TWS: TWI Status
  - these bits reflect to the status of the Two Wired Serial Bus:
    + see: Status Codes Table 18-4. p. 224
* Bit 2 - Res: Reserved Bit
  - always read as 0
* Bit 1...0 - TWPS: TWI Prescaler Bits
  - these give the TWPS value in the equation above
  - values, see: Table 18-2. p. 214

TWI DATA REGISTER
* Bits 7...0 - TWD: TWI Data Register
  - transmit mode -> the next byte to be transmitted
  - receive mode -> the last byte received
  - it is writeable while the TWI is not in the process of shifting a byte -> this happens when TWINT is set by hardware
  - it cannot be initialized before the first interrupt occurs
  - the data remains stable as long as TWINT is set
  - while data is shifted out, data on the bus is simultaneously shifted in
  - always contains the last byte present on the bus
  - handling of the ACK bit is controlled automatically by the TWI logic
